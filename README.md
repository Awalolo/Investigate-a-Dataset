# No-show Medical Appointment Data Analysis

## Introduction

This project analyzes medical appointment data collected from over 100k patients in Brazil. The primary focus will be whether a patient shows up for their appointment. Additionally, variables from the dataset, such as scholarship, hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism, and handicap, will be analyzed to better understand the dataset.

### Question of Analysis
* What is the interpretation of all variables
* What are the major variable influencing patient presence for their appointment.

## Conclusions

This project analyzes medical appointment data collected from over 100k patients in Brazil. Variables such as gender, age, scholarship,	hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism, handicap, SMS_received, and No_show were analyzed. The following conclusion can be made as follows:
* About 80% of patients who booked an appointement showed-up for their appiontments
* Most of the patients who showed-up for their appointment fall in the prime working age, i.e., between age 24 and 54
* Most of the patients who showed and did not show-up for their appointments are females, which are about 65%. Additionally, of the 65% of the females, about 58000 patients showed-up whereas about 13000 patients did not show up.
* Most patients did not receive an SMS regarding their appointments; however, they still showed-up for their appointment. 

## Limitation

The main limitationÂ in this project is the inconsistent SMS reminders sent to patients for their appointments, which undoubtedly contributed to the patients' absences.
